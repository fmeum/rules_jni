def java_jni_library(
        name,
        native_libs = [],
        **java_library_args):
    """A Java library that bundles one or more native libraries created with [`cc_jni_library`](#cc_jni_library).

    To load a native library referenced in the `native_libs` argument, use the static methods of the
    [`RulesJni`](https://fmeum.github.io/rules_jni_javadocs/com/github/fmeum/rules_jni/RulesJni.html) class, which is
    accessible for `srcs` of this target due to an implicit dependency on
    [`@fmeum_rules_jni//jni/tools/native_loader`](targets.md#native_loader). These methods automatically choose the
    correct version of the library for the current OS and CPU architecture, if available.

    The native libraries referenced in the `native_libs` argument are added as resources and are thus included in the
    deploy JARs of any [`java_binary`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/main/be/java.html#java_binary) depending on
    this target.

    ### Implicit output targets

    - `<name>.hdrs`: The auto-generated JNI headers for this library.

      This target can be added to the `deps` of a
      [`cc_library`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/main/be/c-cpp.html#cc_library) or
      [`cc_jni_library`](#cc_jni_library). See [`jni_headers`](#jni_headers) for a more detailed description of the
      underlying rule.

    Args:
      name: A unique name for this target.
      native_libs: A list of [`cc_jni_library`](#cc_jni_library) targets to include in this Java library.
      **java_library_args: Any arguments to a
        [`java_library`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/main/be/java.html#java_library).
